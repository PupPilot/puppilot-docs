## Overview 
To receive webhook events from our system, you must first register your webhook URL. This ensures that our platform knows where to send event notifications for the specified event type.

### Example Request

```json
{
  "event_type": "scribe",
  "webhook_url": "https://your-webhook-url.com/webhook-handler",
  "auth_token": "your-secret-token"
}
```

The `"scribe"` event type triggers a notification to your webhook when a scribing process is complete, allowing your system to take action once the transcription is finalized.
