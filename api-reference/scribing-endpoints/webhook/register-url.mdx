## Overview 
To receive webhook events from our system, you must first register your webhook URL. This ensures that our platform knows where to send event notifications for the specified event type.

### Example Request

```json
{
  "event_type": "scribe",
  "webhook_url": "https://your-webhook-url.com/webhook-handler",
  "auth_token": "your-secret-token"
}
```

The `scribe` event type triggers a notification to your webhook at different stages of the scribing process, allowing your system to track progress and take action accordingly.

### Webhook Triggers
The `scribe` webhook fires at the following stages:

- When a scribe request is created
- When the scribe process starts
- When the scribe process completes

Each webhook event contains relevant information, including the recording session public ID. The `status` field indicates the current stage of the process. The final webhook also includes the output JSON and HTML.

All webhook events have `event_type: scribe`, ensuring clarity that they are related to the scribing process.
