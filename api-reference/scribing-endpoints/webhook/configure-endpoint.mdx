## üì¢ Overview

To receive webhook events, your server must expose a publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint. This endpoint will handle webhook requests securely and validate them. Webhooks are sent as asynchronous HTTP POST requests containing event-related data. These requests must be handled in near real-time, as they will not wait for a response before continuing execution.

## üîó Webhook URL Format

Your server should expose a publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint to receive webhook notifications.

**Example:**

```http
POST https://your-domain.com/webhook-handler
```

## üîê Security & Validation

Each webhook request includes an **HMAC SHA-256 signature** in the `X-Webhook-Signature` header. This signature is generated using a **pre-shared secret token** and the exact request payload.  

### **What is the Secret Token?**
The **secret token** is a unique, private key that **only you and our system know**. It is used to sign webhook requests and allows your server to verify that they are **authentic and untampered**.

- **How is it generated?** You generate the secret token and provide it to our system when configuring the webhook.
- **How should it be stored?** It must be stored securely on your server and **never shared or exposed publicly**.
- **How is it used?** It is used to compute a signature that validates the authenticity of incoming webhooks.

### **How Signature Verification Works**
The recipient must verify this signature to ensure:

- The request **originated from a trusted source** (authentication).
- The request **was not altered in transit** (integrity).

**Example Header:**

```http
X-Webhook-Signature: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
```

### Validation Steps:

1. Extract the `X-Webhook-Signature` from headers.
2. Recompute the signature using your **secret token** and the request payload.
3. Use `hmac.compare_digest()` to compare the expected vs. received signature.
4. If they do not match, reject the request with `HTTP 403 Forbidden`.

## üì• Webhook Handling Example (Python)

This is an example implementation of a webhook receiver **with validation**:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException, Header
import hmac
import hashlib
import json
import logging

app = FastAPI()
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Replace with your actual secret key
WEBHOOK_SECRET = "your-secret-token"

@app.post("/webhook-handler")
async def webhook_handler(
    request: Request,
    x_webhook_signature: str = Header(None)
):
    """
    Webhook receiver with security validation.
    Ensures message integrity using HMAC.
    """
    payload = await request.json()
    headers = dict(request.headers)

    # Validate HMAC Signature
    if not x_webhook_signature:
        logger.error("‚ùå Missing X-Webhook-Signature header.")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Bad Request: Missing signature header.")
    
    # Normalize JSON to ensure signature consistency across different implementations
    normalized_payload = json.dumps(payload, separators=(',', ':'), sort_keys=True).encode()

    # Recompute the expected signature
    expected_signature = hmac.new(
        WEBHOOK_SECRET.encode(),
        normalized_payload,
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    
    if not hmac.compare_digest(expected_signature, x_webhook_signature):
        logger.error("‚ùå Signature mismatch. Potential tampering detected.")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Forbidden: Signature verification failed.")
    
    logger.info("‚úÖ Webhook validation successful.")
    return {"message": "Webhook received"}
```

## ‚úÖ Response Codes

| Status Code | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `200 OK` | Webhook received and validated successfully. |
| `400 Bad Request` | Malformed request (e.g., missing JSON body, missing headers). |
| `403 Forbidden` | Signature verification failed (invalid or missing signature). |

## üîÑ Retry Logic

If your server returns any `4xx` or `5xx` errors, we will retry the webhook.

Webhook retries follow exponential backoff:

1 min ‚Üí 5 min ‚Üí 15 min ‚Üí 1h ‚Üí 2h ‚Üí **Max retries: 5 times.**

If all retries fail, the event will not be resent.

## ‚ùì FAQs

**How do I update my webhook URL?**  
You can provide a new webhook URL via your account settings or by contacting support.

**Can I receive multiple webhook events?**  
Yes. Webhooks are event-driven. You can subscribe to different events.

**What happens if my server is down?**  
We will retry delivery as per our retry policy above.
