### Overview 

The `PATCH /webhook/status` endpoint allows you to **activate or deactivate** a registered webhook for a specific event type.  

**Key Steps:**
1. Send a `PATCH` request to `/webhook/status` with the `event_type`, `is_active` status, and `organization_public_id`.  
2. If successful, the webhook will be updated, and notifications will either be **enabled or disabled** accordingly.

## ðŸ“¤ Example Request

To **disable** a webhook for the `"scribe"` event type, send the following request:

```json
{
  "event_type": "scribe",
  "is_active": false,
  "organization_public_id": "<string>"
}
