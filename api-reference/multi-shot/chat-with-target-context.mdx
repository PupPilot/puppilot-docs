title: 'Chat with Target Context Endpoint'
openapi: 'POST /chat'
---

## Overview

This endpoint allows for multi-turn conversational interactions with Puppilot. It is designed for continuous dialogue where Puppilot can reference:

1.  A **Target Context**: This is an external piece of information you provide, such as a transcript of a conversation between a pet owner and a veterinarian. Puppilot can use this context to inform its responses.
2.  **Chat History**: The backend automatically maintains the history of your conversation with Puppilot using a unique `conversation_id`. This allows for natural, connected dialogue across multiple requests.

Authentication is required for this endpoint. You must include a Bearer token (obtained via the authentication endpoint) in the `Authorization` header of your request. Additionally, you must include the header `X-API-Version: 0.2.0` in your requests.

## Request Body

-   **`message`** (string, required): The latest message or query from the user.
-   **`target_context`** (string, optional): A string containing the target contextual information that Puppilot should be aware of. For example, this could be a detailed case history or a prior conversation transcript.
-   **`conversation_id`** (string, optional): For the first request, omit this field and the API will generate a new `conversation_id`. Include this in subsequent requests to maintain conversation context.

## Example Request (First Request)

```json
{
  "message": "Please provide guidance on urgent signs",
  "target_context": "Owner: Hi, my rabbit Nibbles has been acting strangely—she's not eating her hay and just sits in the corner of her cage. Vet: I'm sorry to hear that—how long has she been like this? Owner: Since yesterday afternoon. She usually runs to me when I open the cage but now she just stays still. Vet: Has she passed any stool or urine in the last 24 hours? Owner: Very little stool, and it looks smaller than usual. I haven't noticed any urine. Vet: Any signs of drooling, teeth grinding, or discomfort when you touch her belly? Owner: She did grind her teeth a little last night and flinched when I tried to pick her up. Vet: Has her diet changed recently, or could she have chewed on anything unusual? Owner: No diet changes, but she might have nibbled a bit of cardboard from her play area. Vet: Is she usually free-roaming, or has she had any recent stress—like a loud noise or new pet? Owner: She's free-roaming in the afternoons, and my nephew was over a couple days ago—he was a bit loud. Vet: How old is Nibbles and has she had any history of dental or digestive issues? Owner: She's 3 and has never had any problems until now. Vet: Thank you, that's very helpful."
