## How to Use

**Required Input**
- **Species** (e.g., dog, cat) must be included for accurate diagnosis.

 **Recommended Details** *(Optional but improves accuracy)*
- **Signalment:** Breed, age, sex, and spayed/neutered status.
- **Symptoms & Timeline:** Describe the primary concern, duration, and any noticeable changes.
- **Medical History:** Prior conditions, medications, and any relevant past diagnoses.

        "Plain English Concise": "Hypothyroidism, Cushing's disease, cardiac issues, laryngeal paralysis, and pain/discomfort are differential diagnoses for the lethargy in a 7-year-old female spayed golden retriever presenting with increased panting; diagnosis requires targeted tests and examination to distinguish between these conditions.",
        "Plain English Summary": "For the 7-year-old female spayed golden retriever exhibiting increased panting and lethargy, hypothyroidism emerges as a leading differential diagnosis due to her age, breed, and sex, aligning with the common signs of lethargy and predisposition in middle-aged, female, spayed dogs. However, cardiac issues should also be considered as golden retrievers are predisposed to such conditions, and symptoms like lethargy could indicate underlying cardiac problems, which need to be ruled out through a thorough cardiovascular examination. Additionally, the potential for pain or discomfort due to musculoskeletal disorders like osteoarthritis should not be overlooked, as these conditions are common in large breeds and can manifest as lethargy and increased panting. Laryngeal paralysis and Cushing's Disease are also possible considerations, though less likely given the current presentation but should be ruled out through appropriate diagnostic tests. Accurate diagnosis would benefit from thyroid function tests, cardiovascular evaluation, and possibly imaging to assess for musculoskeletal issues, allowing for targeted treatment plans."
