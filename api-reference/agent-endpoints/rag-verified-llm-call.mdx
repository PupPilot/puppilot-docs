    "Plain English Concise": "Dog allergies are mainly caused by environmental and food allergens, flea bites, and contact irritants. Genetic factors and immune responses play a role, with certain breeds being more susceptible. Symptoms include itching and inflammation, often leading to secondary infections. Diagnosis involves exclusion of other causes, and treatment includes allergen avoidance and managing infections.",
    "Plain English Summary": "The primary causes of allergies in dogs are immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions triggered by environmental allergens, food allergens, flea bites, and contact allergens. Environmental allergens, such as pollens, dust mites, and mold spores, are linked to Canine Atopic Dermatitis (CAD), which is influenced by genetic factors and defective skin barriers. Food allergies, known as Cutaneous Adverse Food Reactions (CAFR), are commonly triggered by proteins like beef, dairy, and chicken, with potential cross-reactivity between similar proteins. Flea allergy dermatitis is a reaction to flea saliva, while contact allergens include topical medications and shampoos. Key pathophysiological factors include skin barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation, leading to symptoms like itching and inflammation, often resulting in secondary infections. Certain breeds, such as West Highland White Terriers and German Shepherds, are predisposed to these allergies. Diagnosis involves ruling out other causes, and treatment focuses on avoiding allergens, immunotherapy, and managing infections."
