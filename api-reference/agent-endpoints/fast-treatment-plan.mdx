We can process various input formats, including:

## Request Example

```json
{
  "message": "What is the treatment plan for a dog with a foxtail in its paw?"
}
```

## Example Response

```text
- **treatment_goal**: The primary objective is to remove the foxtail and prevent infection or further complications.
- **medications**: Administer antibiotics if there is evidence of infection or if the foxtail has caused significant tissue damage. Pain relief medications may also be prescribed to manage discomfort.
- **symptom_management**: Clean the affected area thoroughly and apply antiseptic to prevent infection. Monitor for signs of swelling, redness, or discharge, which may indicate infection.
- **lifestyle_modifications**: Limit the dog's activity to prevent further irritation or injury to the affected paw. Consider using a protective bootie to keep the area clean and prevent the dog from licking or chewing at the site.
- **regular_veterinary_monitoring**: Schedule follow-up appointments to ensure the foxtail has been completely removed and the area is healing properly. Monitor for any signs of infection or complications.
- **preventative_options**: Advise the owner to regularly check the dog's paws, ears, and other areas for foxtails, especially after walks in areas where foxtails are common. Consider trimming the dog's fur to reduce the risk of foxtails becoming embedded.
