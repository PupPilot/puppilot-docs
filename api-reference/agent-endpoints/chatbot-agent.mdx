## How to Use

**Required Input**
- **input** (string, required): The user's query.
- **model** (string, optional, default=`gpt-4o`): The LLM to query against. It can be one of the following:

## Request Example

```json
{
  "input": "How to get a toy unstuck from a dog's throat?",
  "model": "DeepSeek-R1"
}
```


## Example Response
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "reason": {
    "Plain English Concise": "A dog with a toy stuck in its throat needs immediate vet care. Endoscopic removal is preferred to avoid complications. Do not attempt home remedies like inducing vomiting. Delays can lead to severe esophageal damage.",
    "Plain English Summary": "If a dog has a toy stuck in its throat, immediate veterinary intervention is crucial to prevent serious complications. Esophageal foreign bodies should be removed promptly by a professional, ideally using endoscopy, which is the preferred method due to its high success rate and ability to visualize the esophagus. Delaying removal can lead to severe issues like esophageal perforation, esophagitis, or strictures. Home remedies such as inducing vomiting with hydrogen peroxide are not recommended, as they can worsen the situation. If endoscopy is not successful, surgical intervention may be necessary. After removal, the dog should be monitored for any esophageal damage, and medications like proton pump inhibitors and sucralfate may be prescribed to aid recovery."
