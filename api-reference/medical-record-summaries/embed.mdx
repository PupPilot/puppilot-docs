Once the PDF has been uploaded to the Puppilot system and the AI summarization process has been initiated, you can embed an iframe on your frontend to display the summary output.

## Embedding the iframe

To display a Puppilot summary within your platform, embed the following URL:

```
https://puppilot.co/embed/summary?patient_id={PATIENT_ID}
```

`{PATIENT_ID}`: A unique identifier for the patient. This is passed as a URL query parameter and refers to the name of the original file that was uploaded, including the extension but not including the entire path. 

If - for example - the initial upload call was 
```json
curl -X POST https://agents.puppilot.co/timeline/upload-pdf \
  -F "file=@./medical-records/dogs/tedd.pdf"
```
Then the `patient_id` is **tedd.pdf**

### Example Implementation

```html
<iframe
  src="https://puppilot.co/embed/summary?patient_id=tedd.pdf"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
  frameborder="0"
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```
