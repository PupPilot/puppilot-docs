#### Overview
Addressing the challenge of low data interoperability in veterinary medicine, our system converts all medical records into standardized PDF formats. From there, we structure the data according to the client’s specifications and facilitate seamless integration into their Practice Information Management System (PIMS).
#### Process
- **Step 1:** Receive unstructured or variably formatted medical records.
- **Step 2:** Normalize and convert the data into standardized PDF outputs.
- **Step 3:** Restructure and map the data to align with the client’s schema.
- **Step 4:** Upload the structured data directly into the client’s PIMS, ensuring accurate and efficient transfer.
#### Benefits
- Reduces manual data entry.
- Improves compatibility across diverse veterinary systems.
- Ensures consistent, high-quality data management.
#### Service 
Converts uploaded PDF medical records into structured timelines.
#### Features
- Interactive visualization tools.
- Exclusive front-end interface (not API-driven).
