The Differential Diagnosis Agent Endpoint provides a structured approach to generating differential diagnoses based on a user's input query related to veterinary medicine. It processes the input to assess relevance, retrieves pertinent information, and returns detailed differential diagnosis profiles to assist veterinarians and other users in clinical decision-making.

## Request

### Request Body
The request body should be:
- **input** (string, required): The user's query or description of clinical signs and symptoms in an animal.

### Example Request
```json
input: "A 5-year-old Labrador Retriever presents with vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy after getting into the trash."
```

## Response

### Successful Response (Relevant Input)
If the input is relevant to veterinary differential diagnosis, the API will return a JSON object with:
- **status**: `true`
- **reason**: A structured dictionary containing detailed differential diagnosis information.

#### `reason` Object Structure
The **reason** object contains:
- **Plain English Summary**: A detailed summary of the potential diagnoses.
- **Plain English Concise**: A concise overview of the potential diagnoses.
- **Differential Diagnosis Details**: An object containing comprehensive details about each differential diagnosis.

#### Differential Diagnosis Details Fields
- **Name**
- **Cause / Etiology**
- **Symptoms / Clinical Signs**
- **Risk Factors / Predispositions**
- **Diagnosis & Rule-Outs**
- **Physical Examination Findings**
- **Laboratory Tests**
- **Imaging / Advanced Diagnostics**
- **Definitive Diagnostic Tests**
- **Response to Treatment as a Diagnostic Tool**
- **Commonly Confused With / Differentials to Consider**
- **Prognosis**

### Example Successful Response
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "reason": {
    "Plain English Summary": "The dog may be suffering from gastroenteritis, pancreatitis, dietary indiscretion, or a foreign body obstruction due to ingestion of trash.",
    "Plain English Concise": "Possible causes include gastroenteritis, pancreatitis, or foreign body ingestion.",

      },
      "Commonly Confused With / Differentials to Consider": "Gastroenteritis, foreign body obstruction, hepatic disease.",
      "Prognosis": "Varies from good to guarded depending on severity and response to treatment."
    }
  }
}
```

### Unsuccessful Response (Irrelevant Input)
If the input is not relevant to veterinary differential diagnosis, the API will return a JSON object with:
- **status**: false
- **reason**: A string explaining why the input is not relevant.

#### Example Unsuccessful Response
```json
{
  "status": false,
  "reason": "The input provided does not relate to veterinary differential diagnosis or lacks sufficient context regarding an animal, symptoms, or medical concerns."
}
```

### Error Handling
If an error occurs during processing, the API will return a JSON object with an **error** key:
```json
{
  "error": "<ErrorType>: <ErrorMessage>"
}
```

#### Example Error Response
```json
{
  "error": "ValueError: Invalid input format."
}
```

## Notes
- Ensure that the input string provides sufficient clinical context for the agent to generate a meaningful differential diagnosis.
- The differential diagnoses provided are intended to assist veterinary professionals and should be interpreted by qualified individuals.
- Fields within **Differential Diagnosis Details** may vary based on the specific case and available information.
