## RAG Optimization
Optimized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is at the heart of PupPilot’s architecture and is essential for advancing the field of veterinary medicine. RAG bridges the gap between raw large language models (LLMs) and the high accuracy demanded in medical contexts by combining external knowledge retrieval with generative AI capabilities.

## Validated and Built by Stanford Professors
At PupPilot, all our endpoints leverage an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) engine, developed in collaboration with Stanford professors, to deliver unparalleled accuracy and relevance. RAG’s effectiveness is directly tied to the quality of its underlying data, and we have meticulously curated our dataset by searching the internet for the highest-quality, peer-reviewed, and accredited veterinary medical content. This rigorous approach, validated by AI professors at Stanford, has resulted in an accuracy rate of over 98% for retrieving relevant articles based on user requests.
This high-caliber RAG foundation ensures that our endpoints provide far more reliable and contextually precise outputs than standalone LLMs such as ChatGPT in the context of Veterinary Medicine. By dynamically integrating domain-specific data, we maintain a consistent standard of excellence, critical for the medical field.

## Lego Blocks
Our API endpoints are designed as modular “Lego blocks” to enable flexible integration and scalability. With increasing complexity, users can build solutions ranging from foundational tools to advanced workflows:

- **Chat Endpoints**: These are the simplest blocks, providing conversational AI that combines your preferred LLM with our RAG engine to ensure precision.
- **Agents**: Hyper-focused tools designed for specific veterinary tasks, offering pre-configured functionalities like differential diagnoses and treatment plan generation.
- **Workflow Automations**: These are sophisticated, multi-step processes that include real-world actions, such as retrieving medical records or structuring patient histories.

This modular approach empowers users to launch products rapidly while maintaining accuracy, offering an unparalleled foundation for innovation in veterinary medicine.


## Not Just API Endpoints
Our company specializes in Generative AI services tailored for Veterinary Medicine, focusing on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These services can be accessed through:
- **Whitelabeled mobile or web interfaces**
- **API endpoints** (most common)
- **Custom implementations**

The documentation below is primarily focused on our API endpoints. If you are interested in whitelabeling or more advanced custom implementations please reach out to Gary Peters & Iveta Raymond directly: gp@puppilot.co & iveta@puppilot.co. Please make sure to CC both in the email request.
