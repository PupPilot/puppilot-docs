Quickly and easily get started with PupPilot by accessing our API via HTTPS. Integration is straightforward and can be done using simple HTTP requests. For example, Python users can leverage libraries like requests to interact with our endpoints effortlessly. While we currently do not offer SDKs, our API is designed to be developer-friendly and flexible.

Authentication is powered by Auth0, ensuring secure and reliable access. After reaching out to us at gp@puppilot.co (CC iveta@puppilot.co), you will be onboarded into our system. Once onboarded, you will receive a client_id and client_secret, which you can use to authenticate. By exchanging these credentials, you will obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT), which is required for making secure requests to our API endpoints. Our team is here to guide you through every step of this process, ensuring a smooth and efficient setup.
